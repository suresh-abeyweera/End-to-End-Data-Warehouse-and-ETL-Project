# End-to-End-Data-Warehouse-and-ETL-Project
Data Warehouse is a good skill for any data enthusiast. I learnt some Data Warehouse &amp; ETL concepts and did my own end to end Data warehouse model. I have used SQL server and SSIS as tools in the project.

I selected the below database for my Analysis, and it is a Data set from a bank about loan transactions.

Err!. Challenge from the beginning. This is a MySQL DB and I badly needed to do this project using SQL server. Reason â€“ I already had some knowledge about SQL server and needed to practicing SQL command at the same time doing end to end data warehouse implementation.

No problem. I was able to convert MySQL database to SQL server database from SQL server Migration Assistant for My SQL.
